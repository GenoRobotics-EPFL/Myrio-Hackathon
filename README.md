Myrio is a command-line application designed to identify the taxonomy of a plant from a sample.

The name Myrio is inspired by the scientific name _Myriophyllum spicatum_, commonly known as Eurasian watermilfoil, an aquatic plant frequently found in the Léman.

### Long half-finished list of things left to do

- [ ] Extend the database to vascular plants (_Tracheophyta_) or even further if needed
- [ ] Complement the (BOLD) database with other sources (e.g. Genebank)
- [ ] Compress and make a release of the database(s) used (IMPORTANT: MUST BE LICENSED UNDER [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en), ATTRIBUTION SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE HEADER LINE OF THE FASTA SEQUENCES WHERE IT IS REQUIERED, WE CANNOT USE THE DATABASE ITSELF FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES)
- [ ] License this codebase
- [ ] Implement BLASTN into the main cli-pipeline
- [ ] Implement a robust testing/scoring pipeline
- [ ] Use a ./bin/ solution for executables used
- [ ] Train a model to recognize the species instead of the genus
- [ ] Make a logo
- [ ] And much more ...

### Installation (stub, for Linux)

You'll need the following tools installed beforehand: [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), [`rust toolchain`](https://rustup.rs/), [`seqkit`](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/)
